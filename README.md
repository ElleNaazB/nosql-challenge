This project revolves around analyzing food hygiene ratings across different establishments in the United Kingdom, using <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/nosql-challenge/blob/main/Resources/establishments.json">data</a> provided by the UK Food Standards Agency. Leveraging MongoDB for data storage and manipulation, alongside Python for data analysis, this project aims to assist the editorial team of "Eat Safe, Love," a food magazine, in identifying and focusing on establishments based on their hygienes. Through a series of structured queries and data aggregation pipelines, this project identifies establishments with specific hygiene scores, filters them by geographic location, and assesses their compliance with food safety standards. Key tasks include importing and setting up a <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/nosql-challenge/blob/main/NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb">NoSQL database</a>, updating the database with new establishment data, and conducting exploratory analysis to answer specific questions about establishments' hygiene scores, their distribution across local authorities, and their proximity to certain points of interest. The analysis <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/nosql-challenge/blob/main/NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb">outputs</a>, including the number of establishments meeting certain criteria and detailed information about them, are neatly organized and presented using Pandas DataFrames. This structured approach not only aids in maintaining high standards of food hygiene but also supports the magazine's goal of highlighting top-rated establishments, thereby informing their readership and guiding future articles and reviews.
